## 🚀 How It Works

### For Admins:
1. **Navigate** to Admin → Member Management
2. **Click** the key icon (🔑) next to any member
3. **Confirm** the password reset action
4. **Enter** superuser password when prompted
5. **Receive** the new default password to share with user

### For Users:
1. **Login** with the default password provided by admin
2. **Get redirected** to password change page
3. **Enter** current password (the default one)
4. **Set** new secure password
5. **Continue** using the application normally

## 📊 Database Changes
- Added `has_default_password` column to User table
- Default value: `False` for existing users
- Set to `True` when admin resets password
- Set to `False` when user changes password

## 🛠️ Deployment Steps

1. **Run migration script**:
   ```bash
   python migrate_add_default_password_field.py
   ```

2. **Deploy to PythonAnywhere**:
   - Push changes to Git
   - Pull on PythonAnywhere
   - Reload web app

3. **Test the feature**:
   - Reset a test user's password
   - Verify the user is prompted to change password
   - Confirm password change works

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Default Password**: `Noble1319` (configurable in code)
- **Admin Responsibility**: Must share new password with user manually
- **Security**: Users cannot access app until password is changed
- **Session Management**: Password change enforcement is session-based

## 🎯 Benefits

- ✅ **Security**: Forces users to set secure passwords
- ✅ **User Experience**: Clear prompts and validation
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Tracks who has default passwords
