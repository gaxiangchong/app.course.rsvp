# Password Reset Flow - User Guide

## ✅ Current Implementation (Already Working!)

The password reset feature is **already implemented** to allow users to log in immediately with the default password after an admin resets it.

## 🚀 How It Works

### For Admins:
1. **Navigate** to Admin → Member Management
2. **Click** the key icon (🔑) next to any member
3. **Confirm** the password reset action
4. **Enter** superuser password: `TXGF#813193`
5. **Receive** the new default password: `Noble1319`
6. **Share** this password with the user via email/WhatsApp

### For Users (Immediate Login):
1. **Go to login page** (no need to wait for email)
2. **Enter** their email address
3. **Enter** the default password: `Noble1319`
4. **Click Login** - they will be logged in immediately
5. **Get redirected** to password change page automatically
6. **Enter** current password (the default one)
7. **Set** new secure password
8. **Continue** using the application normally

```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

- ✅ **No Email Required**: Users can log in immediately
- ✅ **No Waiting**: No need to wait for email reset links
- ✅ **Secure**: Forces password change on first login
- ✅ **Admin Control**: Admins can reset any user's password
- ✅ **User Friendly**: Clear prompts and validation

## 📋 What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Admin resets password** → User gets `has_default_password = True`
2. **User logs in** → System detects default password
3. **Login succeeds** → User gets logged in immediately
4. **Session flag set** → `force_password_change = True`
5. **Before request check** → Redirects to change password page
6. **User changes password** → `has_default_password = False`
7. **Normal access** → User can use all features

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Default Password**: `Noble1319` (same for all resets)
- **Admin Responsibility**: Must share password with user manually
- **Security**: Users cannot access app until password is changed
- **No Email Dependency**: Works without email verification

## 🧪 Testing the Flow

1. **Reset a test user's password** as admin
2. **Share the default password** with the user
3. **User logs in** with email + `Noble1319`
4. **Verify** user gets redirected to change password
5. **User sets new password** and continues normally
